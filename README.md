# The official Security Plugin for Solium

This Plugin provides security-focused lint rules for [Solium](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Solium).

The rules have been taken from Consensys' [Recommended Smart Contract Practices](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/recommendations/) and Solium's [Rule Wishlist](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Solium/issues/44).

## Installation
**NOTE: If you're using Solium `v1.0.1` or above, this plugin comes pre-installed as a local dependency and you can skip this section.**

`npm install -g solium-plugin-security`

## Usage
**NOTE: If you've installed Solium `v1.0.1` or above and created `soliumrc.json` using `solium --init`, you can skip this step since solium automatically applies the security plugin for you.**

Add `security` to your `soliumrc.json`'s `plugins` array. Your configuration file should look like:

```json
{
    "extends": "solium:all",
    "plugins": ["security"],
    "rules": {
        ...
    }
}
```

## Developer Setup
- `git clone <URL-of-this-repo>`
- `cd solium-plugin-security`
- `npm install --dev`
- `npm test`

## List of rules
Below are the rules supplied by this plugin and the information on passing options to them and their auto-fixing capabilities.

An example `soliumrc.json` configuring and applying this plugin is:

```json
{
    "plugins": ["security"],
    "rules": {
        "some-other-solium-rule": 1,
        "security/no-low-level-calls": ["error", ["call", "delegatecall"]],
        "security/no-block-members": [1, ["timestamp"]],
        "security/no-throw": "off"
    }
}
```
This tells solium to apply the 3 `security/` rules with special configuration provided and apply the remaining rules of the plugin with their default configurations. If you want to disable a plugin rule, you have to explicitly disable it inside `rules`.

Lint normally using `solium -d contracts/` or `solium -d contracts/ --fix` to apply fixes as well.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add automated tests
- [ ] Refine rule `enforce-explicit-visibility`
- [ ] Add more security rules

## Security rules to be implemented
- [ ] `no-multiple-send-calls`
- [ ] `check-send-result`

...And many more from the sources listed above
